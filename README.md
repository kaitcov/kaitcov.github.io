# kaitcov.github.io

This is my personal website. It is static and hosted through github pages using bootstrap elements and some other CSS for formatting. The reason I used express is because I wanted to try the framework so tested out hosting the page with it before using github pages even though github pages just uses the HTMl/CSS files, not the js.
